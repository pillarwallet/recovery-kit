# Recovery Kit
Recovery Kit is a small tool that allows you to transfer assets contained within, now decommissioned, services from Pillar and Etherspot.

## Download
Head over to https://github.com/pillarwallet/recovery-kit/releases and download the latest version for your device.

## Running on Mac?
Open Terminal (use Spotlight to search for it if you cannot find it) and use this command:

`xattr -c ./Downloads/recovery-kit.app`

- Where `./Downloads/recovery-kit.ap` - this is the path to the application

You should now be able to run the app without any warnings from MacOS.

## Running on Windows?
These are false positives because the app has not been verified via Windows Store. You can safely ignore these warnings and continue to open the application.
